  <h1>SLEEP</h1>


  <h3>Sleep is an essential part of our daily routine, occupying about one-third of our time. It's as crucial for survival as food and water. Quality sleep and getting enough of it at the right times support healthy brain function and maintain physical health. Without adequate sleep, forming or maintaining the pathways in your brain that let you learn and create new memories becomes more challenging, and it's harder to concentrate and respond quickly. Sleep is vital to several brain functions, including how nerve cells communicate with each other. Your brain and body remain remarkably active during sleep, engaging in numerous activities necessary for life, closely linked to the quality of life</h3>
